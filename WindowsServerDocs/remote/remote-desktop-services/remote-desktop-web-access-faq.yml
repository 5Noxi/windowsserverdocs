          What do I do if I forget my password?

      - question: |
          How do I enable password reset?
        answer: |
          Only administrators can enable password reset.
          
          Administrators can enable remote users to change their password from within the RD Web access interface in case it's expired. 
          > [!NOTE]
          > This option isn't helpful for users who forgot their password since the old password still needs to be entered before selecting a new password. For forgotten passwords, you must contact your Active Directory administrator. 
          
          To set up password reset password for Remote Web access:

          1.	Open **Server Manager** on the Server running RD Web Access.
          2.	In the menu under **Tools**, navigate to **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.
          3.	Next, locate your server and navigate to **Sites > Default Web Site > RDWeb > Pages**.
          4.	Select **Application Settings** from the menu. Then, select the setting **PasswordChangeEnabled** and change the value to true.
            
            ![A screenshot of the application setting PasswordChangeEnabled.](media/password-change-enabled-setting.png)

          Now, when you open the RDWebaccess page and try to log in using an expired password, a link appears to reset your password.

          When you open the password reset page youâ€™re presented with the following user interface, where you enter your current password, new password, and confirm the new password.

          > [!NOTE]
          > If the remote server is running in Azure, you need create an endpoint for public port 443 in the Azure management portal so that users can access the RD Web Access portal. 
      
      - question: |
          How do I change my password?
        answer: |
          First, connect to the RD Web Access Server. To change your password, enter Ctrl+Alt+Del and select **Change a password**. Enter in the old password, then the new password, and confirm the new password.
          
          You can change your password only if your network administrator has enabled this feature. If you can't change your password, contact your network administrator.    
          
          If you don't know the password requirements, contact your network administrator.
      
      - question: |
          What is RemoteApp and Desktop Connections?
        answer: |
          RemoteApp and Desktop Connections gives you a customized view of RemoteApp programs and virtual desktops that are available to you.

      - question: |
          What is RemoteApp?
        answer: |
          Using RemoteApp, you can access programs on a remote computer through Remote Desktop Services. Although the programs are running on a remote computer, RemoteApp programs behave as if they're running on your local computer. For example, a RemoteApp program has its own entry in the taskbar, and you can resize, minimize, or maximize the program window.

      - question: |
          How do I start a RemoteApp program?
        answer: |
          To start a RemoteApp program or Remote Desktop session, click the program icon in RD Web Access. When you're prompted for user credentials, log on with your network user name and password.

      - question: |
          What are the public vs. private computer settings?
        answer: |
          If you connect to the RD Web Access website from a public computer, such as a kiosk computer in a public establishment, or from a computer that you share with other users, click This is a public or shared computer. You need to provide both your user name and password each time you sign in to the RD Web Access website.

          If you're using a work computer assigned to you and that you don't share with other people, click This is a private computer.

          To protect against unauthorized access, RD Web Access sessions automatically end after a period of inactivity. If your RD Web Access session ends, you need to sign in again. The amount of time before a session ends is determined by your administrator.

          What is RemoteApp?
        answer: |
          Using RemoteApp, you can access programs on a remote computer through Remote Desktop Services. Although the programs are running on a remote computer, RemoteApp programs behave as if they're running on your local computer. For example, a RemoteApp program has its own entry in the taskbar, and you can resize, minimize, or maximize the program window.

You need to provide both your user name and password each time you sign in to the RD Web Access website.

# Get started with Windows LAPS and Azure Active Directory

Learn how to get started with Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (Windows LAPS) and Azure Active Directory. The article describes the basic procedures for using Windows LAPS to back up passwords to Azure Active Directory and how to retrieve them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For more information on specific OS updates required to use the Windows LAPS feature, and the current status of the Azure Active Directory LAPS scenario, see [Windows LAPS availability and Azure AD LAPS public preview status](laps-overview.md#windows-laps-supported-platforms-and-azure-ad-laps-preview-status).

## Supported Azure clouds

See [Windows Local Administrator Password Solution in Azure AD (preview)](https://aka.ms/cloudlaps) and [Microsoft Intune support for Windows LAPS](/mem/intune/protect/windows-laps-overview) for information on which specific clouds are supported.

## Enable LAPS in the Azure AD device settings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default Azure AD doesn't allow managed devices to post new Windows LAPS passwords to Azure AD. You MUST first have your IT admin enable the feature at the Azure AD tenant level. For more information, see [Enabling Windows LAPS with Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/devices/howto-manage-local-admin-passwords#enabling-windows-laps-with-azure-ad).

## Configure device policy

To configure device policy, complete these tasks:

- Choose a policy deployment mechanism
- Understand policies that apply to Azure Active Directory mode
- Configure specific policies

### Choose a policy deployment mechanism

The first step is to choose how to apply policy to your devices.

The preferred option for Azure Active Directory-joined devices is to use [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune) with the [Windows LAPS configuration service provider (CSP)](/windows/client-management/mdm/laps-csp).

If your devices are Azure Active Directory-joined but you're not using Microsoft Intune, you can still deploy Windows LAPS for Azure Active Directory. In this scenario, you must deploy policy manually (for example, either by using direct registry modification or by using Local Computer Group Policy). For more information, see [Configure Windows LAPS policy settings](laps-management-policy-settings.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If your devices are hybrid-joined to on-premises Windows Server Active Directory, you can deploy policy by using [Windows LAPS Group Policy](laps-management-policy-settings.md#windows-laps-group-policy).

### Policies that apply to Azure Active Directory mode

The Windows LAPS CSP and Windows LAPS Group Policy object both manage the same settings, but only a subset of these settings applies to Windows LAPS in Azure mode.

The following settings are applicable when backing passwords up to Azure Active Directory:

- BackupDirectory
- PasswordAgeDays
- PasswordComplexity
- PasswordLength
- AdministratorAccountName
- PostAuthenticationResetDelay
- PostAuthenticationActions

More plainly: the Windows Server Active Directory-specific policy settings don't make sense, and aren't supported, when backing the password up to Azure Active Directory.

### Configure specific policies

At a minimum, you must configure the BackupDirectory setting to the value 1 (backup passwords to Azure Active Directory).

If you don't configure the AdministratorAccountName setting, Windows LAPS defaults to managing the default built-in local administrator account. This built-in account is automatically identified using its well-known relative identifier (RID) and should never be identified with its name. The name of the built-in local administrator account varies depending on the default locale of the device.

If you want to configure a custom local administrator account, you should configure the AdministratorAccountName setting with the name of that account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you configure Windows LAPS to manage a custom local administrator account, you must ensure that the account is created. Windows LAPS doesn't create the account. We recommend that you use the [Accounts CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/accounts-csp) to create the account.

You can configure other settings, like PasswordLength, as needed for your organization.

## Update a password in Azure Active Directory

Windows LAPS processes the currently active policy on a periodic basis (every hour). To avoid waiting after you apply the policy, you can run the `Invoke-LapsPolicyProcessing` PowerShell cmdlet.

To verify that the password was successfully updated in Azure Active Directory, look in the event log for the 10029 event:

## Retrieve a password from Azure Active Directory

Retrieving Windows LAPS passwords stored in Azure Active Directory is supported by using Microsoft Graph. Windows LAPS includes a PowerShell cmdlet (`Get-LapsAADPassword`) that's a wrapper around the Microsoft Graph PowerShell library. You may also  use the Azure AD and\or Intune management portals for a UI-based password retrieval experience. Windows LAPS doesn't provide any user interface options within Windows for Azure Active Directory password retrieval.

The rest of these instructions describe how to use the `Get-LapsAADPassword` cmdlet to retrieve Windows LAPS passwords from Azure Active Directory using Microsoft Graph.

### Install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell library

The first step is to install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell library:

`Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope AllUsers`

You might need to configure the repository as Trusted for the command to succeed:

`Set-PSRepository PSGallery -InstallationPolicy Trusted`

### Create an Azure Active Directory registered app to retrieve Windows LAPS passwords

The next step is to create an Azure Active Directory application that's configured with the necessary permissions. To review the basic instructions for creating an Azure Active Directory application, see [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)

The app needs to be configured with two permissions: `Device.Read.All` and either `DeviceLocalCredential.ReadBasic.All` or `DeviceLocalCredential.Read.All`. `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All` may also be required in order to query passwords for Microsoft Managed Desktop devices.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Use `DeviceLocalCredential.ReadBasic.All` to grant permissions for reading non-sensitive metadata about persisted Windows LAPS passwords. Examples include the time the password was backed up to Azure and the expected expiration time of a password. This permissions level is appropriate for reporting and compliance applications.
> - Use `DeviceLocalCredential.Read.All` to grant full permissions for reading everything about persisted Windows LAPS passwords, including the clear-text passwords themselves. This permissions level is sensitive and should be used carefully.

### Retrieve the password from Azure Active Directory

You're almost there! First, sign in to Microsoft Graph. Then, use the `Get-LapsAADPassword` cmdlet to retrieve the password.

To sign in to Microsoft Graph, use the `Connect-MgGraph` cmdlet. You must know your Azure tenant ID and the application ID of the Azure Active Directory application you created earlier. Run the cmdlet once to sign in. For example:

```powershell
PS C:\> Connect-MgGraph -Environment Global -TenantId acca2622-272f-413f-865f-a67416923a6b -ClientId 1c2e514c-2ef1-486d-adbb-8da208457957
```

```output
Welcome To Microsoft Graph!
```

> [!TIP]
> For the `Connect-MgGraph` cmdlet to succeed, you might need to modify your PowerShell execution policy. For example, you might need for first run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`.

Now that you're logged into Microsoft Graph, you can retrieve the password.

First, invoke the `Get-LapsAADPassword` cmdlet and pass the name of the device:

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-LapsAADPassword -DeviceIds myAzureDevice
```

```output
DeviceName    DeviceId                             PasswordExpirationTime
----------    --------                             ----------------------
myAzureDevice be8ab291-6307-42a2-8fda-2f4ee78e51c8 7/31/2022 11:34:39 AM
```

> [!TIP]
> Pass the `-Verbose` parameter to see detailed info about what the `Get-LapsAADPassword` cmdlet (or any other cmdlet in the Windows LAPS PowerShell module) is doing.

The preceding example requires that the client is granted `DeviceLocalCredential.Read.Basic` permissions. The following examples require that the client is granted `DeviceLocalCredential.Read.All` permissions.

Next, invoke the `Get-LapsAADPassword` cmdlet to ask for the actual password to be returned:

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-LapsAADPassword -DeviceIds myAzureDevice -IncludePasswords
```

```output
DeviceName             : myAzureDevice
DeviceId               : be8ab291-6307-42a2-8fda-2f4ee78e51c8
Account                : Administrator
Password               : System.Security.SecureString
PasswordExpirationTime : 7/31/2022 11:34:39 AM
PasswordUpdateTime     : 7/1/2022 11:34:39 AM
```

The password that's returned in a `SecureString` object.

Finally, for testing or ad-hoc purposes, you can request that the password appears in clear text by using the `-AsPlainText` parameter:

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-LapsAADPassword -DeviceIds myAzureDevice -IncludePasswords -AsPlainText
```

```output
DeviceName             : myAzureDevice
DeviceId               : be8ab291-6307-42a2-8fda-2f4ee78e51c8
Account                : Administrator
Password               : xzYVg,;rqQ+rkXEM0B29l3z!Ez.}T9rY8%67i1#TUk
PasswordExpirationTime : 7/31/2022 11:34:39 AM
PasswordUpdateTime     : 7/1/2022 11:34:39 AM
```

## Rotate the password

Windows LAPS locally remembers when the last stored password expires, and it automatically rotates the password when the password expires. In some situations (for example, after a security breach or for ad-hoc testing), you might need to rotate the password early. To manually force a password rotation, you can use the `Reset-LapsPassword` cmdlet. For example:

```powershell
PS C:\> Reset-LapsPassword
PS C:\> Get-LapsAADPassword -DeviceIds myAzureDevice -IncludePasswords -AsPlainText
```

```output
DeviceName             : myAzureDevice
DeviceId               : be8ab291-6307-42a2-8fda-2f4ee78e51c8
Account                : Administrator
Password               : &HK%tbA+k7,vcrI387k9([f+%w)9VZz98;,(@+Ai6b
PasswordExpirationTime : 7/31/2022 12:16:16 PM
PasswordUpdateTime     : 7/1/2022 12:16:16 PM
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Azure Active Directory doesn't support expiration of a device's currently stored password via modification of the password expiration timestamp in Azure Active Directory. This is a design difference from the Windows Server Active Directory-based Windows LAPS.
> - Avoid excessively frequent use of the `Reset-LapsPassword` cmdlet. If detected, the activity might be throttled.

## Windows LAPS and Azure AD Connect in hybrid environments

Windows LAPS doesn't rely on [Azure AD Connect](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/connect/whatis-azure-ad-connect-v2), and there are no dependencies between these two technologies. Managed Windows LAPS devices that back up their passwords to Azure AD do so directly via https, with no reliance whatsoever on data synchronization.

Furthermore, the Azure AD and Intune device management portals can only view and manage passwords that have been directly backed up from a Windows LAPS device. Configuring Azure AD Connect to synchronize the on-premises Active Directory Windows LAPS attributes to Azure AD isn't a tested scenario. Manually synchronizing the on-premises Active Directory Windows LAPS attributes to Azure AD **won't** result in those attributes showing up in the Azure AD or Intune device management portals.

While not required for Windows LAPS to operate, whenever you extend your on-premises Active Directory schema as a best practice you should also refresh your Azure AD Connect directory schema. See [Refresh directory schema](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-installation-wizard#refresh-directory-schema).

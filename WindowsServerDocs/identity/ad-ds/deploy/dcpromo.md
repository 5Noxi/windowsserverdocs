# DCPROMO

DCPROMO is deprecated, but you can still use it as a discrete command.

This article contains parameters! Are there other parameter articles I can use for reference?

The first part until "Field Definitions" is a how-to for how to use the command, plus required settings. The second part is a list of parameters you can use with the exe program/command.

# LSA Lookups performance counters

Applies to: Windows Server 2025 (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows Server 2025 is in PREVIEW. This information relates to a prerelease product that may be substantially modified before it's released. Microsoft makes no warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

Excessive Account Name and Account SID lookups can contribute to Active Directory performance degradation. Active Directory performance problems can result in a wide variety of symptoms including (but not limited to) user authentication prompts, outlook/exchange problems, slow logon, LDAP application timeouts and more.

The top causes of excessive LSA Name/SID lookups usually include:

- The client LSA SID/Name Lookup Cache is too small, causing many name lookups to be sent to the domain controller repeatedly.
- An application sending repeated lookup requests that donâ€™t resolve, causing them to be sent to the domain controller repeatedly.
- Isolated names that don't contain a domain name portion and need to be sent to a remote domain controller across every trust resulting in delays.
- Remote lookups taking a long time when DC has to request a lookup from cross-forest, which may contribute to the domain controller running out of RPC threads or building a queue at RPC level, resulting in failures, timeouts, and problems on the client application such as Exchange outages.

It's important therefore to monitor performance of LSA name/SID lookups and adjust applications and configuration accordingly.

Beginning with Windows Server 2025, you can use Local Security Authority (LSA) performance counters to monitor the performance of LSA lookups. The LSA Lookups performance counter set consists of counters that measure performance of LSA Account name and SID lookups. These performances counters are available for both Windows client and Windows Server. See [LsaLookupNames function (ntsecapi.h)](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/ntsecapi/nf-ntsecapi-lsalookupnames) and [LsaLookupSids function (ntsecapi.h)](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/ntsecapi/nf-ntsecapi-lsalookupsids)for an explanation of the algorithm that's used when a name/SID needs to be translated.

LSA enforces security policies, handling user logins, authentication, and authorization processes. LSA verifies credentials when users attempt to access the system based on configured policies. LSA is also used to manage password changes and create access tokens that define permissions for available resources and operations.

LSA Lookups performance counters are accessed using Performance Monitor (`perfmon.exe`).

## LSA Lookups performance counters

LSA Lookups performance counters measure the performance of the LSA lookup process running on the client or server machine.

There are three categories of LSA Lookups performance counters:

- **Name lookups** "Name" counters can be used to measure Name translation via LsaLookupNames and equivalent.
- **SID/Name pair Cache** Can be used to measure the efficiency and size of the sid/name pair cache. Domain controllers do not maintain a name/SID cache. These counters are valid on only a member server/workstation.
- **SID Lookups** "SID" counters can be used to measure SID translation via `LsaLookupSids` and equivalent.

The following table shows the counters that can be added from the LSA Lookups performance counter set and their description, including whether each counter relates to DC, non-DC, or both. Non-DC signifies a member server or member workstation.

| Counter name | Description | DC | Non-DC |
|--|--|--|--|
| `Isolated Names Inbound Requests/sec` | The number of name lookup requests per second that are received from another remote machine that don't include the domain name. | X | X |
| `Isolated Names Outbound Requests/sec` | The number of name lookup requests per second that are sent to another remote machine that don't include the domain name. For example, requests forwarded to the primary domain controller. | X | X |
| `Name/SID cache entries added/sec` | The number of name/SID cache entries added per second. The local LSA keeps a cache of the SID-name pair. The cache is used to speed up the lookup process and reduce the number of requests to the remote machine. Measuring the growth of the cache and the number of requests can help with understanding the performance of the LSA lookup process and if the cache needs to be resized. |  | X |
| `Name/SID cache entries purged/sec` | The number of name/SID cache entries purged per second. The local LSA keeps a cache of the SID-name pair. The cache is used to speed up the lookup process and reduce the number of requests to the remote machine.

## LSA Lookup debug log

For troubleshooting, you can collect a LSA Lookups debug log to track the processes and client details performing sid/name lookups.

### Log file

`%systemroot%\debug\lsp.log & lsp.bak` The default log file size is 10MB.

### Enable

`Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" -Name LspDbgInfoLevel -Value 0x800 -Type dword -Force`
`Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" -Name LspDbgTraceOptions -Value 0x1 -Type dword -Force`

No reboot is necessary.

### Disable

`Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" -Name LspDbgInfoLevel -Value 0x0 -Type dword -Force`
`Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" -Name LspDbgTraceOptions -Value 0x0 -Type dword -Force`

> [!NOTE]
> A larger log file size may be needed in a busy environment. It can be specified using the last 4 bits of the DWORD in LsapDbgTraceOptions. The value should be specified in MBs in hexadecimal. For example, to set the log file size to 50MB, set LspDbgTraceOptions to 0x00320001. Setting the file size to a very large value might make it impossible to open and read using some text editors.

## LSA Lookups caches

The LSA maintains several caches, two of which are discussed here: LSA Name cache, for successfully translated names; and Negative Isolated name cache, for unresolved names.

### LSA Name cache

Member workstations and member servers maintain a local in-memory cache of name/sid pairs that have been successfully translated. This saves round trips to the domain controller and improves performance and efficiency.

Domain Controllers don't maintain a cache; they store the information about domain objects locally. Domain controllers that are Global Catalogs store information about the entire forest. Domain controllers that aren't Global Catalogs forward requests to a Global Catalog if necessary. 

A cache entry can be in one of three states: Valid, Stale or Expired. 

- Default cache entry expiry time is 7 days.
- Default cache size is 4096 entries beginning in Windows Server 2019 and 128 entries in previous versions.
- Default values will suffice in a majority of environments. Although this cache has a very small memory footprint, changing the cache size should be done only if necessary. For example, you can use LSA Lookups performance counters to see if the cache %full is at 100, and whether there's a high Cache %hit  rate as well as many outbound requests/sec to the Domain Controller. This would indicate that the cache may be too small.

The LSA name cache can be tuned using the following settings under `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa`  

- LsaLookupCacheMaxSize (DWORD): The maximum number of entries in the cache. Setting to 0 disables the cache.
- LsaLookupCacheExpireTime (DWORD). The maximum duration of an entry in the cache in minutes. The default is 10080 (7 days).
- LsaLookupCacheRefreshTime (DWORD): The extension of the TTL in minutes in case the entry is fetched from the cache. The default is 10.  

### Negative Isolated name cache

Member workstations and member servers maintain local in-memory cache of isolated names that haven't and can't be resolved. See [LsaLookupNames2 function (ntsecapi.h)](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/ntsecapi/nf-ntsecapi-lsalookupnames2) for more information about Isolated names.

Negative Isolated name cache is not configurable. The maximum size is 8000 entries with a maximum duration of 2 hours each. Names are automatically removed from the this cache if they're resolved. Stale entries are cleaned up by a background task.

# DNS Logging and Diagnostics

>Applies to: Windows Server 2025, Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016

## Performance considerations

DNS server performance can be affected when additional logging is enabled, however the enhanced DNS logging and diagnostics feature in Windows Server is designed to lower the impact on performance. This article discusses DNS server performance considerations when additional logging is enabled.

### Debug logging

Prior to the introduction of DNS analytic logs, DNS debug logging was an available method to monitor DNS transactions. DNS debug logging isn't the same as the enhanced DNS logging and diagnostics feature discussed in this article. Debug logging is a tool that also can be used for DNS logging and diagnostics. See [Using server debugging logging options](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc776361.aspx) for more information about DNS debug logging. The DNS debug log provides extremely detailed data about all DNS information sent and received by the DNS server, similar to the data that can be gathered using packet capture tools such as network monitor. Debug logging can affect overall server performance and also consumes disk space, therefore it's recommended you enable debug logging only temporarily when detailed DNS transaction information is needed.

### Audit and analytic event logging

Enhanced DNS logging and diagnostics in Windows Server includes DNS Audit events and DNS Analytic events. DNS audit logs are enabled by default, and don't significantly affect DNS server performance. DNS analytical logs aren't enabled by default and typically will only affect DNS server performance at very high DNS query rates. For example, a DNS server running on modern hardware that's receiving 100,000 queries per second (QPS) can experience a performance degradation of 5% when analytic logs are enabled. There's no apparent performance impact for query rates of 50,000 QPS and lower. However, it's always advisable to monitor DNS server performance whenever additional logging is enabled.

To enable DNS diagnostic logging:

1. Open a command prompt and type the following command:
 
 ```cmd
eventvwr.msc
 ```

1. Event Viewer opens.
1. In Event Viewer, navigate to Applications and Services, Logs\Microsoft\Windows\DNS-Server.
1. Right-select DNS-Server, select View, and then select **Show Analytic and Debug Logs**. The Analytical log is displayed.
1. Right-select **Analytical** and then select **Properties**.
1. Under When maximum event log size is reached, select **Do not overwrite events (Clear logs manually)**, select the **Enable logging** checkbox, and then select **OK** when asked whether you want to enable this log.

1. Select **OK** to enable the DNS Server Analytic event log.

Analytic logs are by defualt written to the file `%SystemRoot%\System32\Winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows-DNSServer%4Analytical.etl`. Events displayed in the DNS server audit and analytic event logs are treated in the next section.

## Using DNS server audit and analytic events

DNS logs are compatible with Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) consumer applications such as logman, tracelog, and message analyzer. For more information about using event tracing, see [About Event Tracing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/about-event-tracing?redirectedfrom=MSDN).

### Using ETW consumers

You can use ETW consumers such as tracelog.exe with DNS server audit and analytic events by specifying a GUID of {EB79061A-A566-4698-9119-3ED2807060E7}.
You can get tracelog.exe by downloading and installing the Windows Driver Kit (WDK). Tracelog.exe is included when you install the WDK, Visual Studio, and the Windows SDK for desktop apps. For information about downloading the kits, see Windows Hardware Downloads. For example, when you download and install Windows Driver Kit (WDK) and accept the default installation path, tracelog.exe is available at: `C:\Program Files (x86)\WindowsKits\10\bin\10.0.26100.0\x64\tracelog.exe`.

For more information about using tracelog.exe, see Tracelog Command Syntax.

The following examples demonstrate how to use tracelog.exe with DNS audit and analytic event logs:

The following command enables both analytical and audit logging:

```powershell

tracelog.exe -start Dns -guid #{EB79061A-A566-4698-9119-3ED2807060E7} -level 5 -matchanykw 0xFFFFFFFF -f C:\analytic_audit.etl

```

While the trace is active, all analytical and audit events will be recorded in the C:\analytic_audit.etl file that was specified on the command line. You can stop tracing by issuing a stop command:

```cmd

tracelog â€“stop Dns

```

After stopping the trace, you can view the .etl file in Event Viewer by selecting **Action** and then selecting **Open Saved Log**.

![Enable logging window](./media/dns-logging-and-diagnostics/event-viewer.png)

The following example enables only the analytical channel and matches only the keywords to 0x7FFFF:

```cmd

tracelog.exe -start Dns -guid #{EB79061A-A566-4698-9119-3ED2807060E7} -level 5 -matchanykw 0x7FFFF -f C:\analytic.etl

```

A logging level of 5 is used in the previous examples. The following table shows the available logging levels.

| Logging level | Description |
|----------------|----------------|
| 0 (None) | Logging OFF |
| 1 (Critical) | Only critical events are logged, for example process exit or termination. If no logging level is given by the user this level is used by default. |
| 2 (Error) | Only severe error events are logged, for example failures to complete a required task. |
| 3 (Warning) | Errors that can cause a service issue, but are acceptable or recoverable, for example the first attempt to contact a forwarder has failed. |
| 4 (Informational) | Very high-level events are recorded in the event log. These might include one message for each major task performed by the service. Use this setting to begin an investigation when the location of the problem is in doubt, for example a scavenger thread was started. |
| 5 (Verbose) | All events are logged. This provides a complete log of the operation of the service. Use this level when the problem is traced to a particular category or a small set of categories. |

### Audit events

DNS server audit events enable change tracking on the DNS server. An audit event is logged each time server, zone, or resource record settings are changed. This includes operational events such as dynamic updates, zone transfers, and DNSSEC zone signing and unsigning. The following table summarizes DNS server audit events.
